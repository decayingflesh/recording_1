Been working on this project for awhile now.
No clue what they got us drilling for but something don't feel right.
I keep seeing things moving at unbelievable speeds, dashing hall to hall.
Swear I can sometimes hear screams coming from the drill.
Relentless nightmares of things we can't even begin to describe torment most of the crew.
God im already so sick of this, why can't we leave?
What aren't they telling us?
